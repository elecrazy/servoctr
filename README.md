# ServoSDK
---
Welcome to ServoSDK, an open-source software development kit designed specifically for the EnergizeLab Servo. This SDK provides multi-language, multi-platform examples and motion control demos for servo usage, aimed at helping users easily and quickly master the use of various models, including the EM-2030. It is strongly recommended to refer to the corresponding memory table parameter for understanding and verification.
- Supported Protocols:Energize Lab Servo Communication Protocol
- Supported Memory Tables:Basic Memory Table
- Supported Servos:EM Series, EH-3030
- Supported Programming Languages:
  - C:Includes basic librariesï¼ŒIncludes basic libraries, with Example and Demo based on Windows, STC89C52, and STM32F103C8T6.
